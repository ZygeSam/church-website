.
<p>Aimee Semple McPherson, American evangelist (one who preaches Christianity), symbolized important traits of American popular religion in the 1920s and 1930s. She was one of the first female evangelists, the first divorced evangelist, and the founder of the Foursquare Gospel church.</p>

Early life

 
<p>Aimee Kennedy was born on October 9, 1890, near Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada. Her father, James Morgan Kennedy, was a struggling farmer. Her mother, Mildred "Minnie" Pearce was a former member of the Salvation Army (1865; founded by William Booth [1829–1912] as a religious organization with military structure for the purpose of bettering life for the poor and evangelizing the world). Soon after Aimee's birth, her mother took her to the Salvation Army and dedicated her to God's service. Aimee's training was particularly geared toward religious work.</p>

<p>When Aimee was in high school, she began to question her religious beliefs. At the age of seventeen she went to a religious meeting and experienced Pentecostal (a branch of Christianity that supports individual religious experience and evangelism) conversion under the guidance of Scottish evangelist Robert Semple. In 1908 she married Semple and followed him to China as a missionary (one who travels to spread religious teachings). He died soon after arriving in China, leaving her pregnant and penniless. After the birth of Roberta Star, she returned home and continued her Pentecostal work. She also worked with her mother for the Salvation Army.</p>

<p>Travels
Semple married a New York grocery clerk, Harold S. McPherson, in 1913; this marriage ended in divorce five years later. Thereafter she set out as an untrained lay evangelist to preach a Pentecostal-type of revivalism (a religious practice focused on restoring the spirit of God into people) to the people of Ontario, Canada.</p>

<p>Physically attractive and possessing a dynamic personality and the instinctive ability to charm crowds, Aimee Semple McPherson gradually perfected her skills. By this time professional revivalism had achieved a distinctive style and organization; McPherson was in the forefront. Though she initially lived an almost hand-to-mouth existence, following the route of traveling evangelists from Maine to Florida, success meant a move to larger cities in America, England, and Australia. In the cities audiences were often immense, with ten thousand to fifteen thousand people deliriously applauding her. "Speaking in tongues" and successful efforts at faith healing—both practiced by Pentecostal churches—were a part of her ministry. (Pentecostals believe that the sounds made by people while "speaking in tongues" are biblical messages that can be interpreted by another worshipper.)</p>

<p>Her own temple
By 1920 McPherson was permanently established in Los Angeles, California. In 1923 she and her followers dedicated Angelus Temple. She called her new breed of Christian church the Foursquare Gospel, a complete gospel for body, soul, spirit, and eternity. Seating over five thousand people, this served as her center of activity. Backed by a sharp business manager (her mother), McPherson developed a large group of devoted followers. She also became a community figure in tune with the publicity-oriented life of Los Angeles, the film capital of the world.</p>

<p>A popular evangelist, McPherson thrived on publicity and sensationalism (causing an intense and/or unnatural emotional reaction). The most astounding incident occurred in 1926, when McPherson, believed to have drowned in the Pacific Ocean, "miraculously" reappeared in the Mexican desert. Some challenged her tale of kidnapping and mistreatment, claiming she had been in hiding with one of her male followers. The resulting court battle attracted national attention.</p>

<p>McPherson continued her unconventional ways by engaging in a slander suit (when a person is taken to court for telling lies that damaged another's reputation) with her daughter, publicly quarreling with her mother, and carrying on well-publicized vendettas (intense and lengthy fights) with other religious groups. Aimee Semple McPherson died of a sleeping pill overdose in Oakland, California, on September 27, 1944. The Foursquare Gospel church continues to thrive in America today.</p>

      	<P>Lead pastor of Beaverton Foursquare Church in Beaverton, Ore.
Presidential candidate Randy Remington has served as lead pastor of Beaverton Foursquare Church, located in Beaverton, Ore., since 2003. Under his leadership, Beaverton Foursquare thrives as an economically, generationally and ethnically diverse community. The church is actively engaging in both world missions and their local community, including partnerships with the foster care system, first responders and local schools. Its ministry includes a strategic focus on training leaders; the church has planted six churches, with another in the pipeline.</P>
Prior to his time at Beaverton, Randy was senior pastor of two other Foursquare churches and a missionary to Jamaica. He began his ministerial career as a youth pastor in Wyoming and Oregon.


<P>Active in Foursquare, Randy currently serves on the president’s council, missions committee and the Foursquare cabinet. He has been supervisor of the Puget Sound/Alaska District under the multiplied districts model, a divisional superintendent, on the district advisory council of the North Pacific District and served on the Life Pacific College board of trustees.</P>

<p>I am convinced that our best days lie in front of us,” says Randy, whose relationship with Foursquare began three decades ago when he was invited to speak at a district youth camp. “Jesus has a prophetic purpose for The Foursquare Church, and the future opportunities we embrace will flow from that mantle. I am energized by the zeal within our movement to risk everything in fulfilling the Great Commission.</p>

<p>Convinced that a teachable heart is one of the most crucial attributes Jesus imparts to His followers, Randy calls himself a “lifelong learner” and is committed to formal and informal education. His degrees include an Associate of Arts in Practical Theology from Christ for the Nations Institute; a Bachelor of Arts from Life Pacific College, with a major in Biblical Studies and a minor in Cross-Cultural Communication; and a Master of Arts in Strategic Leadership from Life Pacific.</p>

<p>Informally, Randy says he is a voracious reader, podcast listener and seminar attender. Among his Foursquare mentors have been Ron Mehl (whom he succeeded at Beaverton Foursquare Church), Sam Middlebrook, Eloise Clarno, Dick Scott and Larry Spousta. Randy is especially thankful for the unique opportunities afforded him to collaborate with the wider Foursquare family in fulfilling the Great Commission. He wants others to have the same opportunities for relationships, development, partnerships and resources that benefited him.</p>

<p>Randy and his wife, Sandy, have been married for 30 years. They have three adult sons: Joseph, Sam and Thomas. The Remingtons live on a small farm, enjoying its many projects and chores.</p>
